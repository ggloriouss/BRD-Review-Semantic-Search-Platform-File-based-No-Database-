# BRD-Review-Semantic-Search-Platform-File-based-No-Database-
A semantic review search system with Vector Search. All data and vector indexes are stored in a file (no database required). Supports unlimited insert/append reviews (appending vector and metadata every time). All insert/search actions are triggered through the frontend (Leptos) and backend (Rust/axum + fastembed-rs + spfresh).
